        <h2 class="section-header">Harvard Study – The “Flutie Effect”</h2>
        <div class="text-container">
            <ul>
                <li>According to a Harvard Study, on average a football program can receive an 18.6% increase in applications the year following a school’s success on the field. To achieve a similar increase, a school would need to decrease tuition by 3.8%, or increase tuition by 5% to hire better faculty. This is costly! </li>
                <li>Professor Chung found in his research that as sports success increases, quality of applications rise and admission to the school becomes more selective.    
                    <ul class="inner-list">
                        <li>Example: Boston College QB threw game winning hail marry pass against Miami in 1984. Applications shot up by 30% over the next two years.</li>
                        <li>Example: Boise State University had a successful undefeated season in 2006-2007 lead to an 18% increase in applications the following year.</li>
                        <li>Example: TCU was a mediocre program after 40+ years landed in the Top 25 in 2000 and ever since has been a top football program. Applications rose 105% from 2000-2008</li>
                    </ul></li>

        <h2 class="section-header">Power 5 Advantage – Psychological Effect</h2>
        <div class="text-container">
            <ul>
                <li>Huge earning differences between schools in Power 5 conferences vs. Group of 5 conferences. </li>
                <li>The SEC gave $40.9 million to each of its member schools in 2017. The Mountain West gave $1.1 million to each school in same year. </li>
                <li>Earnings differences create recruiting gaps, which widen the gap in competition and further cement long term performance of teams.</li>
                <li>Auburn grossed $42 million in 2011; the Green Bay Packers grossed $48 (per King of Sports).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h2 class="section-header">Solution</h2>
        <div class="text-container">
            <ul>
                <li>Our model highlights the components that allow for a team to compete on the highest level given their restraints (conference, geography, etc.).</li>
                <li>Our findings show that Strength of Schedule has a higher correlation with ability to recruit than conference. Teams outside of a Power 5 conference can obtain these top recruits and compete with the best.</li>
                <li>Top programs who are members of a Power 5 Conference with a sizable alumni base receive significant funds but chart below shows that a high performance level is not necessarily correlated with team spending.</li>
